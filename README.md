## Lesson Objectives Overview

> **Facilitator** - Proceed to Slide 2 - Objectives

In today's talk, you're going to learn about how WordPress was born, and grew into the project we know and love today.
* The Origins of WordPress, before it became known as WordPress.
* The conception of, and original authors of WordPress
* The introduction of Hooks, Plugins, and Themes - which gave WordPress the capability to adapt to your needs.
* The founding of Automattic, which gave WordPress the financial underpinnings to grow its developer base.
* The introduction of the modern Dashboard, which is now your window to writing on the internet.
* The evolution to a true Content Management System, or CMS.

#### Late 2000 - Pre-WordPress - B2 Café log (also referred to as b2)
> **Facilitator** - Proceed to Slide 3

* The concept of an online diary, known as a "Weblog," started as early as the 90's.
   > *Facilitation Talking Point - The phrase "Weblog" was jokingly pronounced "We Blog," which simultaneously shortened the term to "Blog," and made it into a verb.*

* At that time, skills in Web Programming were needed to publish their content to the Web.
* Here you can see the post that started it all, when French Blogger Michel Valdrighi announced he was working on a "[PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php)+[MySQL](https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/php-mysql/mysql.htm) alternative to Blogger and Grey Matter."

   > *Facilitation Talking Point - Valdrighi named his new blogging software "b2 Café Log", for the popular rock song "Song 2" by Blur. Woo-hoo!*

> **Facilitator** - Proceed to the next element in the slide to display the caption.

* Michel announced that features included in his new software would include many of the ones you use in WordPress now, including:
  * Built-in comment system.
  * Good user management.
  * User-avatars.
  * Multiple ways of archiving.
* Notably, the software could be installed on a hosting platform by making small edits to a config file, and then running an installation script; very similar to the famous "5-Minute Install."
   > *Faclitation Talking Point - Years later, Valdrighi was quoted regarding the idiosyncrasies of WordPress's Code, saying, "When you look at WordPress's code and think 'Wow, that is weird; why did they do that this way?' Well, often that was because they just kept doing things the way they were done in b2, and I sucked at PHP."*
* Most notably of all, Valdrighi made the decision to license b2 under the [GNU Pulic License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which meant that it could be modified by anyone.

#### 2002

* b2 grew in popularity, but its developer, Michel Valdrighi, stopped maintaining the project or responding to communications.

#### 2003

> **Facilitator** - Proceed to slide 4 - The Blogging Software Dilemma

* On Januuary 24, 2003, Matt Mullenweg writes a blog post entitled "The Blogging Software Dilemma."
  * In it, he laments that Valdrighi has been missing from the development community, and worries about his safety.
  * Mullenweg speculates about the future, concerned about, among other things:
    * Forward-compatibility.
    * Features and flexibility.
    * Licensing he can politically support.
    * Ease of installation.
> **Facilitator** - Proceed to the next element in the slide, revealing the caption.

  * Mullenweg propses a fork of b2, since it is licensed under the GPL and is Free Software.
* The following day, Mullenweg received a comment from [Mike Little](https://mikelittle.org/), a fellow blogger from Stockport, England.
  * Little indicated that if Mullenweg was serious about his intent to fork b2, he would be willing to contribute.
  * Mullenweg and Little submit over 100 commits between April 1 and May 27, 2003.

#### Whoa. WordPress  
> *Facilitator Talking Point - Matt Mullenweg is known for creating WordPress, but his love of Jazz and Haiku still survive into the modern day. Major releases of WordPress are still nicknamed after Jazz muscians, and the phrase, "Code is Poetry" still remains the mantra.*

> **Facilitator** - Proceed to Slide 5, and proceed slowly to reveal each line of the first WordPress History Haiku.

* On May 22, 2003 Mullenweg updated his blog with a post titled, "Whoa. WordPress." In it he says that "WordPress [will be released] soon, very soon."

> **Facilitator** - Proceed to Slide 6

* Five days later, May 27, WordPress 0.7 is released. It features a 300% performance boost over b2.
* Two days after that, [Donncha O’Caiomh](https://profiles.wordpress.org/donncha/) agrees to work together with Mullenweg and Little to merge his fork, b2++, with WordPress.
  * This becomes known as [WPMU](http://premium.wpmudev.org/manuals/wpmu-manual-2/wordpress-wordpress-mu-and-wordpress-multisite/).

> **Facilitator** - Proceed to show the caption

* The Community begins to form, as communication channels are set up in the form of:
  * [IRC Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat).
  * WordPress.org .
  * WP-docs.
  * The WordPress Wiki.
* Already, however, factions begin to form between developers and the users who utilize the software without development knowledge.

#### 2004

* In January, 2004, WordPress 1.0 "Davis" is launched, named after famed Jazz Trumpeter Miles Davis.

All [versions of WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Versions) were named after jazz greats because Matt had an affinity for jazz music. Version 1.0 was released in January and was named Davis after Jazz musician Miles Davis.

In May 2004, the pricing structure of the competing blogging software Movable Type increased significantly, which caused WordPress downloads on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/) to more than double. There was an increase from 8,670 in April 2004 to 19,400 in May.

Version 1.2 was launched in May with dramatic changes including internationalization, plug-ins, and hooks. [Hooks](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/definitive-guide-wordpress-hooks/) and plugins were put in place so developers no longer had to hack the core code to make a change to the way the blog they were building worked.

A [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/plugin) called "Hello Dolly" started to be packaged with every release of WordPress as a tribute to Louis Armstrong.  It was about this time that the plugin repository was formed.

Developer Ryan Boren came on board. Ryan not only wrote code, but contributed ideas on how development should take place.

In July 2004, the wiki was renamed [Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/).

While stuck in San Francisco over Christmas Matt wrote the code for bbPress, which became the home the WordPress forums.  The forums, a place to talk about everything WordPress, had previously run on miniBB, but had outgrown that software.

#### 2005

Version 1.5 was released and gave the user the ability to change their theme.  WordPress was also now bundled with a default theme, which was an adapted version of Michael Heilemann’s [Kubrick](https://wordpress.org/themes/kubrick-2014/). By March 2005, WordPress had 50,000 downloads, and the number tripled within three weeks.

Users also began to add [CSS stylesheets](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) to change the look of their sites and competitions were held for the best stylesheet.

Also in March, a 100 K party took place in San Francisco.  Jonas Luster,  an employee at CollabNet, was at the party. He and Matt had been talking about what a company built around free software should look like.  At that party, Matt asked Jonas if he would like to be involved with WordPress and Jonas said, "Yes." Jonas became employee number one.

Much consideration was also given to choosing a logo. On May 15th, Matt finally decided on one and after months of work. Matt also acquired the WordPress.com domain name.

[Automattic](https://automattic.com/) was officially launched in December. There were 4 developers as an umbrella company that would include a number of different WordPress organizations. The first of these being WordPress Incorporated with Andy Skelton becoming the second employee of Automattic.

However, problems began to arise when just after the Automattic launch articles on everything from healthcare to web hosting began showing up on WordPress.org. To the community's surprise, Matt was being paid by a company called Hot Nacho to host the articles and was using the money to cover costs. On March 30th, while Matt was in Italy, Andy published an article about it on his blog. The reaction from bloggers was not good. Regardless of Matt's intentions, people saw the articles as an SEO (Search Engine Optimization) tactic and a way to make money.

At this point in time WordPress was still considered a hobby for both Matt and Ryan. Matt had a job at CNET and Ryan worked at Cisco. Matt decided to build a blogging platform. Donncha, who was now the lead developer at WPMU, would lead the project.

WordPress.com opened for sign-ups by invite only in August 2005\. Still, no emphasis was put on making WordPress a Content Management System (CMS).

Project Shuttle, which was a redesign of the administration screens by a small group within the community, also took place.  Sadly, it was not successful.

#### 2006

Automattic was run as what is now known as a distributed company where employees are located in many different areas of the world. This is still in use today. It was also run with a continuous deployment model, which meant new releases of the software were being pushed out continuously.

In January Toni Schneider, who was the CEO of OddPost, which later was acquired by Yahoo Mail, joined Automattic as CEO. He was attracted by the challenges of free software and sought to bring his business experience to the open source project.

One notable idea was to do away with various levels of mediation and have developers deal directly with users.

Management also realized that they had a wealth of passionate developers right at their fingertips and seven of the next ten employees come directly from the WordPress community.

At that time, it was still not clear what the differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org were.  The problem was, much like today, WordPress.com and the self-hosted WordPress.org both had the same name.  To complicate matters, by this point, Automattic had invested millions of dollars in growing the brand associated with both hosted and self-hosted WordPress, so a name change was not an option.

By January 2006 WordPress powered .8% of all websites and it was still experiencing growing pains.  The different approaches of development between developers, designers, and users were becoming a problem.  Other problems also included a heated debate over inline documentation and issues with the Codex.

Despite the problems, WordPress continued to grow and in March 2006, Automattic filed to register the WordPress trademark.   WordPress also issued a public request that no other websites use a domain name with the name "WordPress" in it. This caused much controversy within the WordPress community.

Automattic began experimenting with different ways to make money, including offering support services to enterprise clients.  This led to the Automattic support network, which was launched at $5000 per client a year as well as WordPress VIP hosting which was launched at $250 a month.

By July 2006, Matt announced that he would host a BarCamp style conference called [WordCamp](https://central.wordcamp.org/).  BarCamps were informal gatherings held to focus on new technologies.

The first WordCamp was held on August 5th in San Francisco, with 500 participants coming from all over the world. It was the first time that Matt gave his "State of the Word Address."  His emphasizes was on how software needed to be kept simple. The first WordCamp was a great success.

However, by this time, because of many internal issues within the community, there were some unhappy contributors who believed that WordPress should be run under a committee structure instead of the Benevolent Dictator for Life Structure that it was under.

So in September 2006, several original WordPress developers decided to launch [Habari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habari), a new open source blogging platform with many philosophies in direct opposition to WordPress. Habari was officially initiated in January 2007, but did not last long because of various internal issues.

#### 2007

In January 2007, a [plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) was established and the second WordCamp was held in San Francisco .

Although early WordCamps had no formal structure, they were beginning to happen all over the world. The next big one was held in Beijing, China.

Version 2.1 was released next. This version had many new features, including a new interface, which came complete with spell check and autosave. Up until this point, new versions were released haphazardly and without a set numbering system. However, 2.1 was the first to be released with version 2.2 scheduled to be released four months later. This was to be the beginning of new versions having a deadline.

Although a couple of weeks late, version 2.2 was released in May and featured a new [taxonomy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies) system that incorporated tags, which are a bottom-up classification. Although users creating their own tags and classifications were considered a good thing, there were some issues related to how the new tag system would interact with the database, which was already using a category system.

Mark Jaquith received commit access around this time.

Version 2.2 was released only a few short months after 2.1, but users were becoming increasingly frustrated that development seemed slow. This caused the team to take a closer look at the development process and there was much discussion on moving to a 120-day release cycle. During this period of time more committers were slowly being added.

WordPress 2.3 was released in September. There was some controversy at the time regarding user privacy because WordPress was gathering user data to find out what themes and plugins they were using and to notify them of necessary updates.

Even though WordPress offers free software, ways for developers (who were once hobbyists) to make money were now being considered.  Theme creation was beginning to soar and instead of being paid to build a theme, developers started including links back to their own sites as a form of payment. Often these links were hidden and the customer was unaware, which started to make some themes become spam. Fortunately, Google recognized this and began to not give authority to sites they felt used themes that contained spam. By July 2007, all sponsored link themes were removed from WordPress.net and in late 2007 premium themes began to fill the marketplace.

Free themes began being hosted on themes.WordPress.net, the predecessor to the [WordPress themes repository.](https://wordpress.org/themes/)  Although WordPress was run under a GPL license, debate broke out over whether or not it was right for developers to make money by creating themes.

#### 2008

Although version 2.4 was never released, version 2.5 was released with a new user interface designed by Happy Cog Studios. Version 2.5 introduced the dashboard [widget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget) system and the [short code](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API).  However, the community was not happy with the version 2.5 as they did not feel that they were consulted about the changes or problems. They also felt that there were usability issues that hadn't been addressed.

Over the summer, a usability study was conducted, which led to the release of version  2.7\. Once again redesigns were done and the user interface was improved for usability.

In July 2008, the [WordPress theme directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/) was launched.

WordPress 2.7, known as Crazy Horse, was released next. This time, unlike version 2.5, there was a great deal of emphasis placed on user testing and involvement of the WordPress community.

Jen Mylo, who had been very involved in the user testing for Crazy Horse, joined Automattic.

In December 2008, 200 themes were pulled from the WordPress repository and a statement was added to the "about page" that indicated that all themes were now subject to review. From that point forward, only GPL themes were added to the repository.

#### 2009

By this point in time, Matt was noted as saying that he did not like "where premium WordPress themes [were] going, and that the premium theme market [was not] helping the community to grow."

A problem was found, along with many questions, concerning licensing.  How could developers charge for themes if WordPress was considered free software?

In 2009 Matt took a step back, as Jen Mylo and Ryan Boren took on bigger leadership roles.

Better communication began to happen, which included a handbook project.

In December 2009, the core team of Matt, Mark, Ryan, Westi, Andrew, and Jen met in Orlando. Despite having worked together on the project for many years, for some it was the first time that they met in person.

This led to the idea of having Meetups in which people from the community get together in person to work on code and/or a project. It was and is an idea that continues to grow.

#### 2010

The WordPress Foundation was launched in January 2010.

Community blogs such as [WPTavern](http://wptavern.com/) began to gain importance as gathering points for those who wanted to communicate outside the core project's official channels.

WordPress 3.0 was released with the long anticipated merging of WordPress and WordPress MU.

With the release of WordPress 3.0 WordPress moved away from the word blog and began to refer to itself as a content management system, better known as a "CMS".

### Summary

It has taken WordPress the better part of a decade to get from its humble beginnings of just an idea (used by just a few), to where it is today as a CMS that powers nearly 1/4 of all websites on the internet.  Many people have worked on the WordPress project and the project continues to evolve.  It is going to be interesting to see what is in store for WordPress in the years to come.
